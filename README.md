# Maps_D3
Visualizations such as choropleth maps, bar charts developed in D3.js

The visualization system should contain two views:

- Choropleth map on the left that shows state boundaries and uses a sequential segmented colormap to encode the total amount of losses
- Bar chart on the right that expresses the amount of loss with aligned horizontal position and separates the damage type with vertical position.

The two data files are provided:
- us-10m.json – containing state boundaries
- losses2015_transformed.csv – containing the 2015 indemnities per state.
